cucumber-sshd
=============

  This ruby gem runs an sshd process for testing purpose in cucumber
scenarios tagged as `@sshd'.

  The listening port is changed to 2222 so an unprivileged user can
open it. Host key pair is hard coded, output is silenced, server will
only listen on localhost with sftp enabled, and a standard ssh config
file is written at `.ssh/config'.

  Optionally, cucumber process will block until sshd accepts
connections, and the same sshd process can also be configured to
persist across the whole test suite for faster run.


Warning
-------

* pollute cucumber contexts with multiple instance variables;
* pollute global context with a variable;
* uses `Kernel#at_exit' when `wait_ready' option is enabled.


Usage
-----

### cucumber config

Before do
  # Persists the sshd process across tests (default is to start and
  # stop around each test).
  @_sshd_fast       = true

  # Block cucumber process until sshd accepts new connections.
  @_sshd_wait_ready = true
end
require 'cucumber/sshd/cucumber'

### runtime config

You can control the host name and the port with environment variables.
Here are the defaults:

    SSHD_TEST_HOST=some_host.test
    SSHD_TEST_PORT=2222
